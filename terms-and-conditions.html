    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <div class="two-columns">
      <section>
        <p>All orders placed with MEL Studio are subject to the following terms and conditions. By purchasing from us, you agree to these terms.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Orders</h2>
      <p>Orders are not processed directly through our website. Your order will either be placed via email exchange or by phone. Once your order is placed, you will receive an email confirmation, and again when your order is dispatched.</p>
      <p>Orders are typically processed within 5 business days and shipped with tracking within the contiguous 48 states of the U.S. On some occasions, it may take longer and we apologize for any inconvenience caused. Delivery dates are estimates only and MEL is not liable for delays outside our control.</p>
      <p>If you would like to place an order from outside the U.S., please contact <span class="email" data-prefix="office" data-domain="mel" data-tld="furniture"></span> and we will do our best to help you.</p>
      <p>If your order is missing, or shows as successfully delivered but you have not received the goods, please contact <span class="email" data-prefix="office" data-domain="mel" data-tld="furniture"></span>. Please note that MEL does not accept responsibility for orders that show as successfully delivered.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Returns & Refunds</h2>
      <p>If you are unhappy with your product, please notify us within 3 days of receiving your order. In the event of receiving damaged or faulty goods, please contact us at <span class="email" data-prefix="office" data-domain="mel" data-tld="furniture"></span>.</p>
      <p>You will receive a refund if:</p>
      <p class="indent">Goods are returned to us within 14 days of receipt of delivery.</p>
      <p class="indent">Goods are returned in saleable condition with their original packaging.</p>
      <p>We will not accept returns if the item indicates signs of use. In such cases, the item will be returned to the purchaser. For accepted returns, refunds will be made as soon as possible to the debited account, excluding delivery costs.</p>
      <p>Please note, we cannot refund postage costs and the cost of returned goods is at your expense. Please make sure the items are securely packed, as the parcel is your responsibility until the goods reach us. We are not responsible for goods being lost or damaged in transit.</p>
      </section>

      <section>

      <p class="indent">Claims should be submitted by email to <span class="email" data-prefix="office" data-domain="mel" data-tld="furniture"></span>.</p>
